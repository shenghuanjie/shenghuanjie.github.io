The primary job for instructors in Bio 1B is to lead the laboratory classes. These labs currently cover three major sections: Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Diversity. Exercises include investigations into population genetics, phylogenetic relationships, macroevolution, predator/prey interactions, competition, bioindicators, and structure and function of organisms. BIO 1B is a gateway course to the major field of Integrative Biology that consists of three one-hour lectures and one four- hour combined discussion and lab each week. The class has 48 sections with a maximum of 18 students in each section. Lecturers will be required to lead one discussion and lab per week, create quizzes, grade assignments, attend a Friday instructional meeting, be familiar with lecture, proctor exams, hold office hours and complete other instructional duties as assigned. Senior lecturers mentor new hires and Graduate Student Instructors (GSIs).
