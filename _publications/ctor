The ventral visual stream (VVS) is a fundamental pathway involved in visual object
identification and recognition. In this work, we present a hypothesis of a sequence of
computations performed by the VVS during object recognition. The operations performed
by the inferior temporal (IT) cortex are represented as not being akin to a neural-network,
but rather in-line with a dynamic inference instantiation of the untangling notion. The
presentation draws upon a technique for dynamic maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)
sequence estimation based on the Viterbi algorithm. Simulation results are presented
to show that the decoding portion of the architecture that is associated with the
IT can effectively untangle object identity when presented with synthetic data. More
importantly, we take a step forward in visual neuroscience by presenting a framework
for an inference-based approach that is biologically inspired via attributes implicated in
primate object recognition. The analysis will provide insight in explaining the exceptional
proficiency of the VVS.
